#### :hourglass: Timekeeping & invoice generation for international contractors


Link to deployed app: [TRACK](https://track-work-logger.herokuapp.com/).

Track is my first project, submitted as part of the [Springboard Software Engineering Bootcamp](https://www.springboard.com/). 

The tool is meant for self-employed contractors who work on an hourly basis. Its features include: 
 
* Time-keeping across multiple projects and clients
* Conversion of time spent working into money earned
* If invoicing in foreign currency: __fair__ conversion of money earned into foreign currency _on the day work was done_, rather than bulk conversion at the end of invoice period susceptible to exchange rate fluctuations
* Automatic PDF invoice generation including optional extra charge, discount and VAT
